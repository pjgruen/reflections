How the heck do I set up Sublime to launch from the terminal?

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced? 
	Answer: it allows you to see what has changed and compare side by side

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	It gives you the ability to refference older work 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	Clearly the main pro and con is that you have complete control over when commits are made.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	Because Git was designed to support programming etc while Google Docs is just focused on docs

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	by doing it

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	Obviously you can feel free to experiment if you know you can always revert back to a working copy

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
