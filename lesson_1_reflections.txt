How the heck do I set up Sublime to launch from the terminal?

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced? 
	Answer: it allows you to see what has changed and compare side by side

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	It gives you the ability to refference older work 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	Clearly the main pro and con is that you have complete control over when commits are made.
